# Thoughts after 10 years

Long ago I wrote a few blog articles with the intent of dipping my feet into the world of technical discourse. 
Unfortunately like many of us, real life ended up getting on the way and interest was quickly lost in favor of other things.
Lately I have been operating as a professional mentor of junior engineers. Giving tips, tasks, projects, and such requires a lot of preparation work under the hood - reusable, if the same topic comes up again with another mentee, but right now a lot of it just sits in a folder hoping it might see the light of day again.

Instead, I plan on restarting my blog and writing out a lot of these as educational articles in order get additional benefit from my
time spent on them. I hope someone finds them useful. In the meantime, I have reopened and *lightly* edited a few of my prior articles with no further comment. These were from a decade ago at this point, so many things have changed since then, so if you scroll past this point, keep an open mind.
